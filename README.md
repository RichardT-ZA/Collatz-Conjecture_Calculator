# Collatz-Conjecture_Calculator
Enter a seed and watch the numbers grow with 3n+1 and fall with n/2 on a linegraph. 

**What is the Collatz Conjecture?**
  The Collatz Conjecture is a famous, unsolved problem in mathematics that proposes a simple iterative process will eventually lead any positive integer to 1.
  Pick a starting number (the seed). If the number is even, devide it by 2 and write your new number underneath. If the number is odd, times it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process until you reach the loop 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1...
  (Now try with negative numbers)

I made this spreadsheet to visualise the paths that numbers take to eventually land in the 4, 2, 1 loop.
I got the idea from this Veritasium video: [The Simplest Math Problem No One Can Solve - Collatz Conjecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)
